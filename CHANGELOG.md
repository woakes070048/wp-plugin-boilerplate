# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project follows a **foundation-first** release model:

- early versions establish architecture and contracts
- backward compatibility is taken seriously
- breaking changes are documented explicitly

- Field reference updated to list all supported options
- `.gitignore` finalized

---

## [1.0.1] – 2026-02-09

### Added
- Explicit documentation for bundled dependencies
- `vendor/` directory listed as a first-class plugin component
- Release checklist enforcing dependency inclusion

### Changed
- Plugin bootstrap now guards against missing bundled dependencies

### Notes
This release does not change the public API or plugin behavior.
It reinforces distribution guarantees and architectural contracts.

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-02-06 – Stable Foundation Release

This is the first **stable** release of WP Plugin Boilerplate.

v1.0.0 marks the point where the architecture has been validated by building and
stress-testing real plugins across admin, frontend, lifecycle, and rename scenarios.

### Added
- Clear separation between Admin, Settings, and Public runtime layers
- Unconditional runtime wiring for public behavior
- Tab-based settings ownership (no schema layer)
- Deterministic uninstall with prefix-based cleanup
- Dynamic menu capability resolution based on tab visibility
- Fully documented field definition structure
- Explicit lifecycle guarantees (activation, deactivation, uninstall)

### Changed
- Settings are now fully owned by tabs
- Import / Export scoped as global operations
- Reset scoped as tab-specific operation
- Documentation rewritten to reflect v1.0 architecture
- Advanced Topics rewritten as architectural reference

### Fixed
- Capability mismatch between menu visibility and tab access
- Uninstall not cleaning up all plugin-owned options
- Runtime behavior incorrectly gated during bootstrap
- Documentation drift from actual architecture

### Stability Guarantees
Starting with v1.0.0:
- Public behavior is always registered at runtime
- Admin configuration flows cleanly into frontend behavior
- Plugin lifecycle behavior is predictable and safe
- Plugin can be renamed and reused without breaking behavior

Breaking these guarantees requires a major version bump.

## [v0.9.6] — 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- Prevented fatal errors during plugin uninstall by removing class dependencies from `uninstall.php`
- Clarified and enforced global scope for Import and Export operations

### Changed
- Documented the distinction between global (Import/Export) and tab-scoped (Reset) settings actions
- Hardened lifecycle edge cases to align with WordPress execution model

### Philosophy
- Capability scope must match data scope
- Uninstall runs outside the plugin context and must remain procedural

---

## [v0.9.5] — 2026-02-06

### Changed
- Consolidated admin menu registration into `Admin` class
- Removed redundant MenuRegistrar abstraction
- Menu placement is now fully configuration-driven via entry file
- Tabs can optionally be exposed as submenu items without UI duplication
- Plugin admin UX refined (About & Help tabs aligned with documentation)

### Fixed
- Plugin action links now correctly point to settings screen
- Removed lifecycle duplication around uninstall handling

### Philosophy
- Menu structure is code, not state
- Admin behavior is deterministic and explicit
- Boilerplate favors clarity over configurability

---

## [v0.9.4] — 2026-02-05

### Changed
- Formalized project licensing as **GPL-2.0-or-later** to align with WordPress ecosystem requirements.
- Added canonical LICENSE file and aligned README and composer.json.

---

## [0.9.3] — 2026-02-05 – Architecture Consolidation

### Structural
- Restructured directories to reflect architectural boundaries:
    - Settings logic consolidated under `Settings/`
    - Admin workflows isolated under `Admin/Actions`
    - Tabs elevated as first-class units of composition
    - Field definitions and rendering decoupled from persistence
- Removed schema-era directory layout
- Enforced PSR-4 structure aligned with domain responsibility

### Changed
- Settings ownership moved from schemas to **tabs**
- Tabs are now the single source of truth for:
    - option keys
    - field definitions
    - settings ownership
- Import and export redesigned as **global operations**
    - single export file for all settings tabs
    - import restores matching tabs only
- Multisite handling clarified:
    - default scope is `site`
    - `network` scope is opt-in via `ScopedContract`

### Removed
- Schema-based settings layer
- `SchemaContract`
- `SettingsTabContract`
- Per-tab import/export actions
- Schema-driven directory structure

### Philosophy
- Structure enforces intent
- Tabs define behavior, not schemas
- Persistence is explicit and isolated
- Multisite behavior is deliberate, never implicit
- Import/export favors safety over convenience

---

## [v0.9.2] — 2026-02-04

- Updated composer.json

---

## [v0.9.1] — 2026-02-03

- Added CHANGELOD.md

---

## [v0.9.0] — Foundation Release

First public release of **WP Plugin Boilerplate**.

This release establishes the **core architecture, contracts, and guarantees** for building long-lived, maintainable
WordPress plugins.

### Added

- Opinionated, OOP-first plugin architecture
- Single entry-point plugin bootstrap
- Centralized hook registration via Loader
- Strict PSR-4 namespace and file structure enforcement
- Class-based extension model

#### Settings System

- Schema-driven settings architecture
- One schema per settings tab
- One option key per tab
- Automatic default resolution
- Settings repository as the single access point
- Support for presentation-only tabs (About, Help, Docs)

#### Field System

- Schema-defined, intent-based fields
- Core input fields (text, textarea, checkbox, select, radio, etc.)
- Media fields storing attachment IDs
- File size limits and MIME validation
- Clear separation between intent, rendering, and validation

#### Media Handling

- Native popup filtering for `image`, `audio`, and `video`
- Safe enforcement for `document`, `archive`, and generic media types
- Filename or thumbnail previews based on attachment type
- Backend validation for all media fields

#### Multisite Support

- Explicit multisite handling
- Per-schema scope declaration (`site` or `network`)
- Network-scoped settings restricted to Network Admin
- No implicit switching between option APIs

#### Tools

- Per-tab import and export
- Schema-validated and sanitized imports
- Per-tab reset to defaults
- Capability-protected actions

#### Documentation

- README.md (architecture and principles)
- HOW-TO-USE.md (practical usage guide)
- FIELDS.md (complete field reference)
- ADVANCED-TOPICS.md (multisite, migrations, internals)
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- MIT License

### Stability

- Public APIs and contracts introduced in v0.9.0 are considered **stable**
- Internal refactors may continue until v1.0.0
- No breaking changes will be introduced without documentation and migration guidance
