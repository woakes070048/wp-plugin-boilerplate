An opinionated, OOP-first WordPress plugin boilerplate focused on **long-term stability**, **explicit architecture**, and **predictable behavior**.

This boilerplate is designed for plugins that are expected to live for years, evolve safely, and be maintained by more than one developer.

---

## Core Principles

- Single entry point for orchestration
- Centralized hook registration via a Loader
- Clear separation between Admin, Settings, and Public runtime
- Explicit capability and scope rules
- Deterministic lifecycle behavior

---

## Folder Responsibilities

| Directory        | Responsibility |
|------------------|----------------|
| `src/Admin`      | Admin UI, menus, admin actions |
| `src/Settings`   | Settings tabs, defaults, scope, persistence |
| `src/Public`     | Frontend and runtime behavior |
| `src/Support`    | Shared infrastructure |
| `src/Lifecycle`  | Activation and deactivation |
| `assets`         | CSS, JS, static assets |

---

## Settings Architecture

Settings are owned directly by individual tabs.

Each settings tab is responsible for:
- its option key
- default values
- sanitization
- storage scope (site or network)
- capability enforcement

There is no separate schema layer.

Settings must be accessed exclusively through the `SettingsRepository`.
Direct calls to `get_option()` or `get_site_option()` are considered architectural violations.

---

## Mental Model

- Classes define behavior
- Tabs define configuration boundaries
- Admin configures behavior
- Public executes behavior
- Settings connect admin and runtime
- Uninstall runs outside the plugin context and must remain procedural

---

## Who This Is For

This boilerplate is a good fit if:

- your plugin has frontend behavior
- your plugin must survive renames and refactors
- settings are business-critical
- multisite support matters
- long-term maintainability matters

If you are building a quick, disposable plugin, this may be more structure than you need.

---

## v1.0 Stability Guarantees

Starting with v1.0.0, this boilerplate guarantees:

- Public behavior is always registered unconditionally
- Admin configuration flows cleanly into runtime behavior
- Plugin lifecycle behavior is predictable and safe
- Uninstall cleans up all plugin-owned data
- Renaming the plugin does not break behavior

Breaking these guarantees requires a major version bump.
